### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am **Vikas Kumar Jha**. You might already know me from my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/vikasjha001) or one of my Udemy Courses, here is my [Udmey Profile](https://www.udemy.com/user/vikas-kumar-jha-5/).

### Experience

I have 13+ Years of experience working with a leading IT company known as Wipro Technologies. I left my job on the 13th of October 2023 to continue to teach students full-time. Now, I spend most of my time creating courses on Udemy or YouTube. I also write technical articles which are published on my website [itpanther.com](https://itpanther.com/blogs).
Here is my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vikasjha001/).
